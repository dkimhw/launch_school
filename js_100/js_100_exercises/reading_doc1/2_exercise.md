### Lowercase

Question: Find out whether JavaScript has a method to lowercase a string, for example converting 'Aloha, World!' into 'aloha, world!.

Answer:
* We can use MDN to look for a method that might convert a string to lowercase.
* First find the object string: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String]
* On the left hand side are a list of methods that can be accessed by string objects. 
* Browsing the left-hand side shows that there is a method called `toLowerCase()`.

```javascript
'Aloha, World!'.toLowerCase();
```
