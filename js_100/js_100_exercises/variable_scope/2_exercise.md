### What's my value? part 2

Question:

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.


```javascript
console.log(greeting);

let greeting = 'Hello world!';
```

Answer:

I think this one returns an error because the variable is undeclared at the time of usage. There is no hoisting with `let`.
