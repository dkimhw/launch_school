## Readiness



Readiness for Written: It's getting there. I would say I am 50% - I think 3-4 weeks out (targeting weekend of 09/25). I took a lot of time to practice and get together notes.

* **Review, Review, Review** - this is the most important thing you can do. 
  * Review problems you did
  * Review the notes
  * Explain the concepts aloud
* Go over:
  * Implicit, Explicit
  * Naming convention
* Find problems to practice explaining (1 per day)



## Resources

### Dedication

Take it seriously:

*  To do that, I spent **4 hours per day** of studying and waking up at 7AM to practice with a regular student and attended weekly 109 study groups held by Elizabeth (advanced student) or Dalton(TA). **I rewrote notes, practiced explaining code with words and articulating code out loud.** I also did some practice on Codewars (7 kyu- 6 kyu) as a supplemental exercises before taking the test.



Written Test Notes

* 20 questions (3 hours) - you need to pace yourself - track your time
  * Have two timers
  * 3 hour time
  * One that loops 8 minutes
* Over prepare - not easy
  * It requires detailed and precise language
  * Precisely explain why the code does what it does - what does it output. What does it do on this line?
    * You don't have to explain all of the lines of code
    * Just the relevant lines
* Examples
* Common mistakes 
  * Generally the problem is with the precision of language (no pseudocode)



Interview Notes

* Two problems (40 to 50 minutes)
  * Live with interviewer
  * You are writing pseudocode and using pedac process
    * It helps to formulate your thoughts
    * Highly encourage to do lite PEDAC so that you can do better
  * Not all requirements are explicit - you have to ask the questions
    * Ask question for the interviewer - clarify
    * Some requirements are implicit - you need to have clear test cases to make sure you are solving for the right problem
  * **Talk out loud while coding**
    * **You have to communicate your thoughts**
  * Meet other students to practice
* Be comfortable solving medium difficulty problems
  * This is because you are anxious and you don't do your best when you are relaxed
  * The problems are going to be easier than medium difficulty problems but again it's harder in an interview setting
* Go to codewars
  * Be comfortable with solving 5, 6, 7 kyu
* Practice, practice, practice
  * Practice on codewars while talking out loud
  * Practice pair coding

### Books

* https://launchschool.com/books/javascript - will be good to review to make sure if there are concepts covered there that I didn't cover and important to the written test



### Tools

* Good markdown tool (more visually pleasing): [https://typora.io/]



### Confirm Format

* Are you going to be actually writing code in written assessment on are you explaining code in precise language?



### Content of the Written Exam

  - Completed
- variable scope, especially how variables interact with function definitions and blocks
  - Completed
- **primitive values, types and type conversions**
  - Initial Draft Done (need follow-up)
  - **I am not sure how much type conversions we need to know - worth reading through the JS101**
- how passing an argument into a function may or may not permanently change the value that a variable contains or points to
  - Completed
- working with Strings, Arrays, and Objects. In particular, you should be thoroughly familiar with the basic Array iteration methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `find`) and how to use Object methods to access the keys and values in an Object as an Array.
  - Completed
- understand that arrays are objects, and be able to determine whether you have an Array
  - Completed
- understand the concepts of *pass-by-reference* and *pass-by-value*
  - Completed
- [variables as pointers](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/more_stuff#variablesaspointers)
  - Initial Draft Done (need follow-up)
- [console.log vs return](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/basics#expressionsandreturnvalues)
  - Completed
- truthiness: `false` and `true` vs. falsy and truthy
  - Completed

  - Completed
- function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions
  - Completed
- implicit return value of function invocations
  - Completed
- first-class functions
  - Completed
- [side-effects and pure functions](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/functions#sideeffects)
  - Completed
- **naming conventions (legal vs idiomatic)**



### Written Exam Plan

1. Focus on 1 to 2 hours every day. Show up everyday to study and do consistent, quality work every day. Even on days you do not necessary want to
2. Attend Study Groups **(Completed)**
   1. Really understand what will be on the exam
   2. The format
   3. The level of depth you need to understand
   4. Ask for tips preparing
3. Centralize the Notes **(Completed)**
   1. Create an initial set of centralized notes that you can refer to when studying for the written exam
   2. Review that notes cover all the major topics
   3. Will also serve as a reference when you take the exam
4. Initial Start
   1. Build Starter Examples **(Completed)**
      1. Review the quizzes
      2. Review the exercises in JS101
   2. Practice on codewars - start **(Completed)**
   3. Review notes **(Completed)**
5. Refine the Notes **(Completed)**
   1. Before I can refine - I need to start practicing and reading the notes and seeing if the notes are good enough
   2. Go through each lesson and read through areas where I am not familar and we need to add
      1. Really synthesize the different concepts into a succinct description of the different topics listed there
   3. Go through the quizzes again?
   4. Add to areas where I am weak
6. **Find more examples to walk through**
   1. Find more to practice in LS basics
   2. Create your code examples for all the specific topics and practice answering what the code is doing in certain situations and what it is an example of
7. Create pre-made snippets. Like explaining filter, map - you don't want to be doing that
   1. So separate note for that
8. On Repeat
   1. Practice CodeWars
      1. Precise language
   2. Practice Examples
      1. Precise language
   3. Review Notes
