### Dedication

Take it seriously:

*  To do that, I spent **4 hours per day** of studying and waking up at 7AM to practice with a regular student and attended weekly 109 study groups held by Elizabeth (advanced student) or Dalton(TA). **I rewrote notes, practiced explaining code with words and articulating code out loud.** I also did some practice on Codewars (7 kyu- 6 kyu) as a supplemental exercises before taking the test.

### Tools

* Good markdown tool (more visually pleasing): [https://typora.io/]



### Confirm Format

* Are you going to be actually writing code in written assessment on are you explaining code in precise language?



### Content of the Written Exam

- assignments and comparison
  - Initial Draft Done (need follow-up)
- variable scope, especially how variables interact with function definitions and blocks
  - Initial Draft Done (refinement needed)
- primitive values, types and type conversions
  - Initial Draft Done (need follow-up)
  - I am not sure how much type conversions we need to know - worth reading through the JS101
- how passing an argument into a function may or may not permanently change the value that a variable contains or points to
  - Initial Draft Done (need follow-up)
- **working with Strings, Arrays, and Objects. In particular, you should be thoroughly familiar with the basic Array iteration methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `find`) and how to use Object methods to access the keys and values in an Object as an Array.**
- **understand that arrays are objects, and be able to determine whether you have an Array**
- understand the concepts of *pass-by-reference* and *pass-by-value*
  - Initial Draft Done (need follow-up)
- [variables as pointers](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/more_stuff#variablesaspointers)
  - Initial Draft Done (need follow-up)
- [console.log vs return](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/basics#expressionsandreturnvalues)
  - Initial Draft Done (need refinement)
- truthiness: `false` and `true` vs. falsy and truthy
  - Initial Draft Done (need follow-up) - dig into more resources online
- function definition and function invocation
- function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions
- implicit return value of function invocations
- first-class functions
- [side-effects and pure functions](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/functions#sideeffects)
- naming conventions (legal vs idiomatic)



### Writtent Exam Plan

1. Focus on 1 to 2 hours every day. Show up everyday to study and do consistent, quality work in every day. Even on days you do not necessary want to
2. Attend Study Groups
   1. Really understand what will be on the exam
   2. The format
   3. The level of depth you need to understand
   4. Ask for tips preparing
3. Centralize the Notes
   1. Create an initial set of centralized notes that you can refer to when studying for the written exam
   2. Review that notes cover all the major topics
   3. Will also serve as a reference when you take the exam
4. Refine the Notes
   1. Really synthesize the different concepts into a succinct description of the different topics listed there
   2. Add to the weak areas where my notes are not strong enough
5. Review the quizzes
6. Review the exercises in JS101
7. Take ten+ code
   1. Explain in precise language what it is doing
   2. This is to get practice in using precise language
8. CodeWars
9. Flashcards
10. Rinse & Repeat

What to bring to the written exam

  * 

5. Interview Study Plan
  * Attend Study Groups
    * You get to practice & find people to study together
  * Re-do the Javascript exercises
    * Pair up with another student and send each other 3â€“4 small snippets of code with the questions: What does this output? What does this return? Why?
      * Study together
    * For each exercise, use the PEDAC approach
    * For each exercise, using precise language describe in: (109 Study Guide)[https://launchschool.com/lessons/cdfe3681/assignments/cc654f56] to explain what the code is doing including syntatically description as well as core programming concepts
    * Practice writing code orally
      * Review:
        * What to clarify & ask with interviewer?
      * Describe your thinking process as you read the program 
    * Use descriptive names
    * Test often your code
  * Codewars after you go through those exercises
  * Review methods on Quizlet or Anki
