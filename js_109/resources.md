### Tools

* Good markdown tool (more visually pleasing): [https://typora.io/]


### Confirm Format

* Are you going to be actually writing code in written assessment on are you explaining code in precise language?


### How to Study

1. Focus on consistency - show up every day. Get quality study blocks early in the morning. 
  * We are looking at 1 to 2 hours everyday to start out
  * Then I want to move this up slowly but this is something I can commit to with no issue

2. Control your emotions

3. Written Study Plan (Focus on the concepts & use of precise language)
  * Attend Study Group
  * What you think you know: Go through each specific topic of interest from Launch School’s study guide and in a separate markdown file (ex. call it js109_notes.md) write out your own explanation to each specific topic of interest without looking at your notes.
  * Review the correct answers: Review and study your notes (or Launch School course material) on the specific topic of interest (maybe review all your notes — it can’t hurt).
  * Write down the correct answers: Again write out explanations for each specific topic of interest in your markdown file from earlier while looking at your notes and be sure to use correct language when describing code.
  * Compare answers: Compare your initial understanding of each specific topic of interest versus the correct explanation you wrote down after reviewing your notes.
    * This will help you understand the weak topics you need to review more
  * Write down code examples: Create your own code examples for all of the specific topics of interest (or any specific topics of interest that you’re still unsure about) and practice answering (verbally or written) what the code is doing in certain situations and what it is an example of.
  * Take ten or so code from exercises and codewars:
    * Explain in precise language what is happening with the code
  * Review the exercise in lesson6:
    * Those were helpful
  * Take the JS101 Quizzes again
    * This will retest your knowledge on the topics
  * Review & Study more

5. Interview Study Plan
  * Attend Study Groups
    * You get to practice & find people to study together
  * Re-do the Javascript exercises
    * Pair up with another student and send each other 3–4 small snippets of code with the questions: What does this output? What does this return? Why?
      * Study together
    * For each exercise, use the PEDAC approach
    * For each exercise, using precise language describe in: [https://launchschool.com/lessons/cdfe3681/assignments/cc654f56] to explain what the code is doing including syntatically description as well as core programming concepts
    * Practice writing code orally
      * Review:
        * What to clarify & ask with interviewer?
      * Describe your thinking process as you read the program 
    * Use descriptive names
    * Test often your code
  * Codewars after you go through those exercises
  * Review methods on Quizlet or Anki



It says watch the videos? What does that mean?
